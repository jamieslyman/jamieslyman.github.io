This used to be on owoyiff.me until my domain registration lapsed.
Now, this repo just has some dumb HTML stuff I've cobbled together (with mostly code stolen from W3Schools and the like, of course)
`notacountdown.html` counts down to Christmas in a nice, minimal fashion.
`notacountdown_september.html` counts down to the 21st of September, because of the song by Earth, Wind, and Fire.
`timemoney.html` takes a number (representing your hourly wage) and displays the amount of money you've made on your shift in real-time. It stores the start time and wage in a cookie so that if the page is invalidated or otherwise unloaded, it'll pick right back up when you load it again.
